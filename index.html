        <h3 class="lb_heading">Satoru Gojo </h3>
        <p class="lb_text">Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. 
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant. He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming, during his fight with Toji Fushiguro, that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored one." This can be further exemplified when he was tasked with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion .
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <p class="lb_text"><u><b>Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant:</b></u> Satoru, in addition to his overwhelming levels of cursed energy, is also an incredibly formidable martial artist in close combat, with extraordinary physical prowess to back up his skills. He was capable of completely overpowering Jogo in hand-to-hand combat, delivering several precise attacks on Jogo's fatal spots, and could even casually fight off and overpower both Jogo and Hanami with sheer close combat, easily countering their attacks and landing powerful hits that swiftly pummeled them into submission.
        <br>
        <u><b>Immense Strength</b></u>Satoru possesses tremendous physical strength to fight against powerful curses without a problem, easily causing severe injuries to Jogo with powerful punches and throwing him a considerable distance with a single kick during their fight. He was also able to easily rip out Jogo's head and later on his arm with sheer physical force and even managed to casually rip out Hanami's roots. He could casually rip apart transfigured humans, tearing them apart limb-by-limb.
        <br>
        <u><b>Immense Strength</b></u>Satoru is an extremely fast fighter, capable of moving faster than the eye could perceive. He managed to easily outpace Jogo, throwing almost imperceptible punches and kicks. Satoru can also eliminate a thousand transfigured humans in five minutes.
        <br>
        <u><b>Tactical Intellect:</b></u>Gojo is quite tactical and capable of figuring out his opponent's plan with minimum information. He has also shown to be extremely adaptable to any enemy he has ever faced so far, knowing precisely what to do to counter their techniques and find ways to defeat them. This is best displayed during his bout against Jogo, Hanami, Choso and Mahito where he was shown to be capable of conceiving multiple battle strategies while fighting at blinding speeds, protecting civilians, keeping property damage to a minimum, all while dodging and evading the attacks of the four curses.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Yuji Itadori</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">uji is a fair person who truly cares for not only his comrades but anyone he views as people with their own wills, despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. He highly commends "the value of life," and to this end, he will ensure that others receive a "proper death". Because of this, he believes that it is morally unethical for him to take another human life, and tries to avoid any possibility of doing so unless as a last resort

        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">He is also not without his more energetic and outgoing traits. Such as his frequent comedic moments where he was seen alongside Nobara gushing about Tokyo and his eagerness to train with Gojo or even when entertaining both Junpei and his mother. Yuji is also highly passionate whenever he's focused on achieving certain goals and being quite stubborn when confronted about them, such as when Yaga questioned why Yuji wanted to become a sorcerer. He is also quite naïve due to his inexperience in the world of cursed spirits and jujutsu sorcerers, but is shown to be a quick learner, capable of adapting to his surroundings and picking up how to use cursed energy quickly.
        </p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <p class="lb_text"><u><b>Superhuman Strength:</b></u> Yuji is quite powerful even without the usage of cursed energy, as he can destroy walls with ease, throwing a lead ball with enough force to bend a soccer goalpost, and has also been able to throw a car. As powerful as he is, especially when it comes to fighting, his exceptional strength can often be augmented to further levels with the usage of both the Divergent Fist and the Black Flash allowing him to exorcise cursed spirits. 
        <br>
        <u><b>Enhanced Speed and Reflexes:</b></u>Yuji is shown to have great speed and can finish a 50-meter track within 3 seconds, implying he can run at speeds of 60.12km/h (37.3mph). He's also been shown to dodge the attacks of all five opposing sorcerers from the students from Kyoto School who tried to murder him.

        <u><b>Enhanced Speed and Reflexes:</b></u>Yuji is shown to have great speed and can finish a 50-meter track within 3 seconds, implying he can run at speeds of 60.12km/h (37.3mph). He's also been shown to dodge the attacks of all five opposing sorcerers from the students from Kyoto School who tried to murder him. He has been shown to be fast enough to evade Choso's Piercing Blood, which travels at the speed of sound, proving he has superb reflexes.


        <u><b>Enhanced Durability: </b></u> Yuji's durability surpasses the average sorcerer. He was able to continuously take hits from Choso during their fight and even Piercing Blood, an attack moving at the speed of sound didn't pierce Yuji immediately. He was also able to withstand numerous attacks from Mahito in his Instant Spirit Body of Distorted Killing form and continue fighting.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Megumi Fushiguro</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">Megumi is a relatively tall, slim young man with fair skin and green eyes (dark blue in the anime adaptation). He has uniquely styled black hair with long spikes that jut out in every direction around his head, resembling a sea-urchin (according to Hakari).
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">Megumi typically wears a standard Jujutsu High uniform with a dark blue jacket over a long-sleeved white dress shirt. His uniform pants match his jacket and only reach to just above his shins. He wears long black socks that cover his exposed ankles and finishes his outfit with low-top brown shoes. He also has a blue tracksuit for training.
        </p>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <p class="lb_text"><u><b>Immense Tactical Intellect:</b></u> Megumi's most reliable and imposing asset as a sorcerer is his mind. He is a young genius, a cerebral fighter whose focus in a battle is to outwit his opponent rather than overpower them. Megumi assesses all threats logically and deals with them in a strategic manner. Using his advanced deducting reasoning skills, Megumi thinks of clever ways to deal with every situation as it comes. This is regularly showcased by Megumi's consistent talent for deducing his opponent's strengths and weaknesses in the heat of battle.
        <br>
        <u><b>Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant:</b></u>Megumi is a strong fighter who has never been afraid to get in close to hit his opponents. He's always been stronger than normal people his age, able to effortlessly beat down a human pile of bullies on his own.[103] In one of his earliest missions, Megumi was already strong enough to destroy a curse with just the swipe of his bare hands.
        <br>
        <u><b>Expert Weapons Specialist:</b></u>Megumi was trained by Maki, the best cursed tool user at Jujutsu High, to use a variety of different weapons. He can keep cursed tools in his shadow, so Megumi is capable of swapping out multiple weapons for himself at any time.


        <u><b>Advanced Endurance:  </b></u>  Megumi is especially tough for a human being, with high pain tolerance, exceptional stamina, and especially impressive durability. He's shown his toughness on numerous occasions where he was able to withstand a beating and survived the battle, sometimes even overcoming his own exhaustion to achieve victory.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Sukuna</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">According to a legend, during the golden age of jujutsu over 1,000 years ago, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon (仮想かそうの鬼神きじん Kasō no Kijin?), though in truth was a human sorcerer, and other sorcerers gave their all to defeat him. After his death, he became a cursed spirit, and his curse was too strong for his body to be fully destroyed. 
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">His past appearance is described as a demon with four arms and two faces.[2] Currently, he appears similar to the host he is in, but with spiked hair and with unique markings on his forehead, nose, cheeks, and torso. He also has a second pair of eyes under his normal eyes, which are usually closed.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Yuta Okkotsu </h3>
        <p class="lb_text">Yuta Okkotsu (乙おっ骨こつ憂ゆう太た Okkotsu Yūta?) is a major supporting character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series and the main protagonist of its prequel series, Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Jujutsu High. He was initially a special grade cursed human haunted by his late childhood friend, Rika Orimoto. Satoru Gojo mentored Yuta and enrolled him at Tokyo Jujutsu High. 
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">Yuta is currently a second-year student at Jujutsu High where he works as a jujutsu sorcerer. He was training overseas in Africa with Miguel until after the Shibuya Incident when he returned to Tokyo.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <p class="lb_text"><u><b>Expert Weapons Specialist:</b></u> While first training as a sorcerer, Yuji was given a katana mainly as an object to stabilize his cursed energy.[37] Through vigorous training with Maki, the most proficient cursed tool user at Jujutsu High, Yuta became decent with a sword, able to hold his own against cursed spirits[38] and even Geto, who has exceptional physical prowess.
        <u><b>Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant:</b></u>Yuta has grown into a very capable close-quarters combatant who is more than comfortable engaging his opponent's up close. He generally throws single powerful smashing blows that can crush his opponent in a single move. A mere front kick to Yuji's sternum was enough to send him reeling back and one backhand from Yuta knocked Choso out cold.
        <br>
        <u><b>Overall Skill Level:</b></u>Yuta is one of only four special grade sorcerers recognized by Jujutsu High. While being haunted by Rika's vengeful spirit, Yuta was immediately registered as a special grade due to Rika's immense power, making him the most recent person to receive the ranking.
