        <h3 class="lb_heading">Satoru Gojo </h3>
        <p class="lb_text">Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. 
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant. He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming, during his fight with Toji Fushiguro, that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored one." This can be further exemplified when he was tasked with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion .
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Abilities</h4>
        <p class="lb_text"><u><b>Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant:</b></u> Satoru, in addition to his overwhelming levels of cursed energy, is also an incredibly formidable martial artist in close combat, with extraordinary physical prowess to back up his skills. He was capable of completely overpowering Jogo in hand-to-hand combat, delivering several precise attacks on Jogo's fatal spots, and could even casually fight off and overpower both Jogo and Hanami with sheer close combat, easily countering their attacks and landing powerful hits that swiftly pummeled them into submission.
        <br>
        <u><b>Immense Strength</b></u>Satoru possesses tremendous physical strength to fight against powerful curses without a problem, easily causing severe injuries to Jogo with powerful punches and throwing him a considerable distance with a single kick during their fight. He was also able to easily rip out Jogo's head and later on his arm with sheer physical force and even managed to casually rip out Hanami's roots. He could casually rip apart transfigured humans, tearing them apart limb-by-limb.
        <br>
        <u><b>Immense Strength</b></u>Satoru is an extremely fast fighter, capable of moving faster than the eye could perceive. He managed to easily outpace Jogo, throwing almost imperceptible punches and kicks. Satoru can also eliminate a thousand transfigured humans in five minutes.
        <br>
        <u><b>Tactical Intellect:</b></u>Gojo is quite tactical and capable of figuring out his opponent's plan with minimum information. He has also shown to be extremely adaptable to any enemy he has ever faced so far, knowing precisely what to do to counter their techniques and find ways to defeat them. This is best displayed during his bout against Jogo, Hanami, Choso and Mahito where he was shown to be capable of conceiving multiple battle strategies while fighting at blinding speeds, protecting civilians, keeping property damage to a minimum, all while dodging and evading the attacks of the four curses.
        <br>
        <p class="lb_text">
        <h4>Inherited Techniques:</h4>
        <u><b>Limitless (無下限 Mukagen)</b></u> <br>
        <u><b>Infinity (無限 Mugen)</b></u> <br>
        <u><b>Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue (術式順転「蒼」 Jutsushiki Junten・Ao)</b></u> <br>
        <u><b>Cursed Technique Lapse - Maximum Cursed Energy Output: Blue (術式順転出力最大「蒼」 Jutsushiki Junten Shutsuryoku Saidai・Ao)</b></u> <br>
        <u><b>Cursed Technique Reversal: Red (術式反転「赫」 Jutsushiki Hanten・Aka)</b></u> <br>
        To Top It all Up He Has "SIX EYES BY BORN"

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Yuji Itadori</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">uji is a fair person who truly cares for not only his comrades but anyone he views as people with their own wills, despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. He highly commends "the value of life," and to this end, he will ensure that others receive a "proper death". Because of this, he believes that it is morally unethical for him to take another human life, and tries to avoid any possibility of doing so unless as a last resort

        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">He is also not without his more energetic and outgoing traits. Such as his frequent comedic moments where he was seen alongside Nobara gushing about Tokyo and his eagerness to train with Gojo or even when entertaining both Junpei and his mother. Yuji is also highly passionate whenever he's focused on achieving certain goals and being quite stubborn when confronted about them, such as when Yaga questioned why Yuji wanted to become a sorcerer. He is also quite naïve due to his inexperience in the world of cursed spirits and jujutsu sorcerers, but is shown to be a quick learner, capable of adapting to his surroundings and picking up how to use cursed energy quickly.
